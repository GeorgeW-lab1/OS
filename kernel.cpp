/*
 * OPTIMIZED KERNEL WITH GRAPHICS STATE MANAGEMENT
 * ================================================
 * All graphics rendering uses atomic frame composition
 * Unified color palette prevents inconsistencies
 * State machine ensures complete frames with no trailing
 *
 * This file used to contain the entire kernel (~10,500 lines) in one
 * translation unit. It has been split into per-component files under
 * kernel_parts/, included below in their original order. This is a pure
 * physical reorganization -- no code was reordered, added, or removed,
 * so the compiled kernel is unchanged. The split points were chosen at
 * brace-depth-0 boundaries (verified with a script) so no class,
 * struct, or function is torn across two files.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing: this is still effectively one translation
 * unit stitched together via #include, not independent compilation
 * units, because later parts rely on types/functions/globals defined
 * earlier (e.g. WindowManager's out-of-class method bodies in
 * 10_window_manager_impl.h need the complete TerminalWindow type from
 * 09_terminal_window.h). Do not reorder these includes.
