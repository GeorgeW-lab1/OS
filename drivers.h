 * the titlebar) and control simply goes back to the compositor as
 * normal — mouse_poll() will just report in_window == 0 here, the

 * consumes/latches any button-down transition since the previous
 * snapshot, so a fast click between two frames is never lost); the
 * five fields are then read back with individual `in al, 0xF0..0xF4`
 * byte reads. Like the disk/gfx mailboxes, this is synchronous — the
 * snapshot is already complete by the time the triggering OUT
