/* ====================================================================
 * test_module.h — activatable Bochs self-test module.
 *
 * This is the "module for activation" half of the request: the test
 * execution code from test_main.cpp, lifted out of a standalone
 * kernel_main and repackaged as a single entry point the real kernel
 * can call on demand.
 *
 * Activation:
 *   The kernel's terminal command handler calls test_module_run() when
 *   the user types  test.  Everything the old test_main.cpp did at boot
 *   (run __init_array, Phase 1 bochs_cpu_init(), Phase 2 load a tiny
 *   guest + tick it) now happens inside that one call instead.
 *
 * Output target:
 *   test_main.cpp wrote its breadcrumb / fault-tag / GUEST rows to the
 *   hardware VGA text buffer at 0xB8000. The real kernel has no text
 *   mode — it is a framebuffer GUI. So this module renders the SAME
 *   three-row VGA-style overlay (breadcrumbs, fault tag, live GUEST
 *   line) into a TerminalWindow via a tiny sink interface, plus mirrors
 *   everything to port 0xE9 exactly as before.
 *
 * The module owns NO kernel headers — it talks to the kernel only
 * through TestSink below, so it stays a clean, separately compiled TU.
 * ==================================================================== */

/* ── Sink: how the module talks back to the kernel ──────────────────────
 * The kernel supplies one of these. The module never touches a Window,
 * a framebuffer, or 0xB8000 directly; it only calls these hooks. That
 * keeps the module activatable from anywhere (terminal command, desktop
 * icon, boot self-test) without a compile-time dependency on the GUI.
 *
 *   put_line(s)        — append a finished line of plain text.
 *   vga_cell(row,col,
 *            ch,attr)  — set one "VGA text cell". row 0..2, col 0..79.
 *                        attr is a classic VGA attribute byte
 *                        (bg<<4 | fg). The kernel maps it to whatever
 *                        it actually draws (window glyph, real text
 *                        cell, etc).
 *   flush()            — push the current frame to screen NOW. Critical:
 *                        test_module_run() blocks the kernel main loop
 *                        for the whole duration of a run, so the normal
 *                        per-frame swap_buffers() never gets to fire.
 *                        Without flush() the window would just freeze
 *                        on the pre-test frame and show nothing — even
 *                        though the overlay cells were written. The
 *                        module calls flush() after each breadcrumb and
 *                        before each long blocking call (bochs_cpu_init,
 *                        bochs_cpu_tick) so the trail is visible live,
 *                        and the screen still shows how far it got even
 *                        if a step hangs.
 *
 * Any hook may be null; the module checks before calling.
